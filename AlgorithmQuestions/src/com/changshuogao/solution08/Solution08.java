/*I was asked this during a recent interview. 

Lucky number – a number is a lucky number if it comprises of combination of 4′s and 7′s. 

For example , if 32 is the input number, the next nearest lucky number would be 44. 

Similarly , 
43 -> 44 
45 -> 47 
1004 -> 4444 

Input number can be of any digits. 

Design an algorithm that will take any random number and return its next lucky number*/
